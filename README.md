## FAQ

### What kind of game is this?

I honestly have no idea yet

### How did you make it

Using the wonderful open source [Bevy Game Engine](https://bevy.org/).
And I got an amazing jump start by using the [bevy_game_template](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_game_template) which provides CI config and a web build.
